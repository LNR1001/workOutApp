/*
This navigator is typically responsible for managing the high-level navigation
flow of your application. It usually handles the initial routes and determines
the entry point of your app. The AppNavigator.js file may contain logic related to authentication flows,
onboarding screens, or other global navigation requirements. It can include routes
for screens like login, signup, onboarding, or a splash screen.
It may conditionally render different stacks or navigators based on the user's
authentication state. It can handle deep linking or URL-based navigation if required.
It sets up the overall navigation structure for your app and can switch between
different stacks or navigators based on the user's context.
